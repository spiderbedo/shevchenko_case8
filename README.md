Data Shield is a small educational toolkit for investigating text-based data leaks and basic web-attack traces.
It extracts and validates sensitive artifacts (credit cards, API keys, passwords), decodes hidden messages, detects suspicious log activity (SQLi, XSS, malicious user-agents), and normalizes noisy records (phones, dates, INN).
